Yes, you always wanted to have a Bubble Bobble arcade board at home. First you couldn't get it because your parents somehow did not understand you. Then you grow up and your wife doesn't understand you either. Don't worry, MiST(er) is here to the rescue.

I hope you will have as much fun with it as I had it while making it!

## Supported Games

In chronological order:

 1. Tokio (Scrambled Formation)
 2. Bubble Bobble

Some of the MRA files provided may not work as there is some variation in Bubble Bobble bootleg hardware which is not implemented. Official Tokio MRA file will not work because the MCU hardware is not yet implemented in the core. Only the bootleg MRA for Tokio works.

Note for developers: Tokio hangs up after a life is lost if the RBF is compiled without sound.
