 v0.90: This is a beta release version of my SMS Boot Loader.
 v0.91: Minor changes I can't remember!

 This simple program, once run on an original Sega Master System, let
 you choose and execute a program from one of the three available slots:

  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  System                             SMS1    SMS2+   MD-PBC  |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+
  |  Cartridge slot                     yes     yes     yes     |
  |  Card slot                          yes     no      yes     |
  |  Expansion slot                     yes     no      no      |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------+

 It has the advantage of not checking any country code or header, so
 basically it is possible to boot up an original Japanese mycard game
 (for SG-1000 or Mark III) on your US or European Master System 1.

 You can also use it to boot Brasilian 8 megabits games which are
 not supported by all models of Master System 1.

 Last but not least, using a homemade pinout converter, it would be
 possible the same way to boot up any SG-1000/SC-3000 or Mark III/SMS
 cartridge.

 The problem of course is to be able to run the actual SMS Boot Loader
 on a real system. Easiest solution is to use a development cartridge,
 but the most interesting one is to replace the machine BIOS by this
 Boot Loader.

 Things done:
   Code run from RAM is copied at 0xC700 as with the real BIOS,
   although this is not the same code, no known software rely on
   values at that location.
   Slot number is written to 0xC000 before booting.

 Things to do:
   Fix the bug when pressing button 1 on the title run cartridge
   directly (it happens sometimes).
   Detect data present on the three slots (and suggest one).
   Leave VDP Registers in the same state as the original BIOS does.
   Clear three byte variables (currently stored at 0xD00?).
   Clean and release source code.

 Enjoy!
